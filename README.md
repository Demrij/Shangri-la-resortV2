# Shangri-la-resortV2
could not commit on last repository, i exceeded the file size limit and couldn't push or commit anything and i was done figting with it, so im leaving out all large media and starrting this new repository.

// I was going to add the repository link for my original project - before I lost connection and my ability to pull or push anything so when I created this document (version 2) and copy and pasted my first 3 pages of basic html I had coded on cprg-218-assignments-3 I wanted to still give the commits from the original project but it never transfered over to my github repo so I sadly don't have my commits link from the beginning of my html coding... I have it in my github desktop but idk how to transfer it over, It wont push over. It is on my computer if proof is needed.//
